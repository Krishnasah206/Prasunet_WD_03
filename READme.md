# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Introduction

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game project! This project is a part of Task 3 of the Prasunet Company Internship in Web Designing. The goal of this project is to create a simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game allows two players to play against each other, taking turns to mark their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can click on the grid to place their marks.
- **Turn-based Mechanics**: The game automatically switches turns between Player X and Player O.
- **Win Detection**: The game detects win conditions and announces the winner.
- **Draw Detection**: The game detects draw conditions when all cells are filled without a winner.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the game grid and elements.
- **CSS**: Used to style the game grid, cells, and other elements to provide a visually appealing interface.
- **JavaScript**: Used to implement the game logic, handle player interactions, and update the game state.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the game.
2. **Taking Turns**: Players take turns clicking on an empty cell in the 3x3 grid. Player X always goes first.
3. **Winning the Game**: The game will announce the winner when a player successfully places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
4. **Draw Condition**: If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game will announce a draw.
5. **Restarting the Game**: After a game is completed, players can reset the game to start a new match.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the game.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that contains styles for the game.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic and interactions.

## Future Improvements

- **AI Opponent**: Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- **Score Tracking**: Add a score tracker to keep track of wins, losses, and draws.
- **Improved UI/UX**: Enhance the user interface and user experience with animations and sound effects.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Further optimize the game for a better mobile experience.
